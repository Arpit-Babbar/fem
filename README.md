# Codes on finite element method
These codes are prepared as material for teaching finite element method.

* deal.II: Examples using deal.II library in C++
* deal.II/ex00: An introduction to C++ using PDE problem
* fenics: Examples using Fenics in Python
* dg1d: A simple 1-D DG code in Python for scalar conservation law

## How to get the code ?

* The easiest way is by using git which will download the code in directory ```fembook```
```
git clone https://github.com/cpraveen/fembook.git
```
* Download a zip file by clicking on the green button called "Clone or download" and then "Download ZIP".
* Or use wget
```
wget https://github.com/cpraveen/fembook/archive/master.zip
```
and unzip it
