# Solve Poisson equation in 2d/3d

Same as ex02a but here we solve on triangular grid. See the readme file of ex02a.

To see the differences between the two codes, diff them

```shell
diff -y ../ex02a/demo.cc demo.cc
```

or colordiff

```shell
colordiff -y ../ex02a/demo.cc demo.cc
```

or use a gui diff tool

```shell
meld ../ex02a/demo.cc demo.cc
tkdiff ../ex02a/demo.cc demo.cc
```
